# StudyGo Android Application
### Description
StudyGo is an academic social media app with the goal of facilitating good study habits for students and raising the average GPA of participating Universities and consequently their students. This will be achieved by incentivizing studying at different locations near campus through giving them discount codes at participating locations. These locations will boost sales through hosting study hours. This app will allow users to connect either one on one or by public group sessions through networking and a messaging platform. Students have the option to track their grades per class and see a visualization of study time to grade performance over a semester. Teachers will be able to use this app to set up different study events and companies can set-up study events as well. This will all be achievable through web browser and android applications. Security will not be a major concern with this initial build.
